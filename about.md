Ancient Software Developer, living in the internet since 1998. 
Was FIDOnet member, had own BBS and seen X.25 networks in action ;)

Old Unix and Linux user, still have FreeBSDs on some of my laptops.

Somehow I touched almost all popular languages, OSes, frameworks and technologies, but still think that I'm dumb and know nothing.

### Contacts

I'm primary work as external consultant, so please don't spam me with full-time job offerings.
